    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>and I was sitting outside at Mission Bay.</p>
    <p>That's when I saw the lights in the sky...</p>
    <p>and an object that looked like a UFO!!</p>
    <p>Or maybe just a reflection?</p>
    <p>Sometimes it's hard to say about things like these.</p>
    <p>I decided to phone a friend, get a second opinion.</p>
